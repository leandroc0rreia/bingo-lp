# lp_bingo

It is a project carried out at the University within the scope of the curricular unit "Programming Laboratories". It consists of a Bingo game where there is the player and manager side, developed in Java.

It is divided into three parts/commits in which the first was carried out in a console where the user has control of the card and numbers that are drawn. The second part was performed in Java Swing, in which there are two interfaces, the player and the manager, but there is no connection between them. The third is already the connection between the two interfaces, thus simulating a game room.
